# Welcome to JavaScript Project!

> Foreword, I'm **Quach Cong Tuan**, everyone calls me **Tunnie**. I have graduated from British National College BTEC - FPT with National Diploma from 2022. I have started pursuing and becoming a Full-Stack Software Engineer. I will start the process of pursuing programming languages and techniques such as: HTML, CSS, JS and then get more advanced with ReactJS, NodeJS, PHP, Laravel, C#, ... I will finish everything in the shortest time.

## Installation
	git clone https://github.com/Tunnienguci/javascript-basic.git
Copy the link above and paste it in your programming tool's terminal. The system will automatically display the chapters in this JavaScript course. I will describe the courses in detail at this GitHub link.

## Configuration files
Let's initialize a .html file and then create a path from JavaScript to it.
Example:
Create Javascript file by [NameFile].js

		<script src="/Chapter 1/CreateVariable.js"></script>

Then when running the program through "Live Server", open Devtools at that website and select Console in the toolbar above.
